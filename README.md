## Overview

FlexShard is a novel blockchain-integrated vector data management system designed specifically for the dynamic, decentralized nature of edge computing environments. The system addresses critical challenges in managing high-dimensional vector data across resource-constrained edge devices while ensuring data integrity, provenance, and fault tolerance.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Vector Sharding**: Hierarchical, clustering-aware sharding that organizes vectors based on semantic similarity
- **Scale-Free Network Topology**: Balanced network structure with adaptive leader selection
- **Lightweight Consensus**: Energy-efficient two-phase consensus protocol activating only 51% adjacent quorum
- **Hybrid Architecture**: On-chain metadata for provenance, off-chain vector storage for efficiency
- **Edge-Optimized**: Designed for resource-constrained environments with microsecond-level latencies
- **Fault Tolerance & Self-Healing**: Supports re-sharding and topology reformation under dynamic edge node participation.

## System Architecture

The system is organized into two sharding layers:

1. **Semantic Vector Shards**: Vectors are grouped using semantic-aware clustering algorithms.
2. **Scale-Free Role-Based Partitioning**: Nodes are organized into a scale-free network with adaptive leader/peer roles based on their capacity and graph centrality.

The architecture supports five core protocols:

- `Balanced Scale-Free Graph Construction`
- `Find Reliable Leader`
- `Dynamic Sharding`
- `Block-Validation`
- `Resource Load-Balance`

Each protocol is implemented with low communication overhead and designed for scalability across edge devices.


## Performance Highlights

- **57.8% higher throughput** than FAISS at low workloads
- **38Ã— improvement** over blockchain-based alternatives (Binecone)
- **Microsecond-level latencies** (11-25 microseconds)
- **22.5% lower memory usage** compared to non-sharded approaches
- **Linear scalability** up to 200+ nodes
