## Overview

FlexShard is a novel blockchain-integrated vector data management system designed specifically for the dynamic, decentralized nature of edge computing environments. The system addresses critical challenges in managing high-dimensional vector data across resource-constrained edge devices while ensuring data integrity, provenance, and fault tolerance.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Vector Sharding**: Hierarchical, clustering-aware sharding that organizes vectors based on semantic similarity
- **Scale-Free Network Topology**: Balanced network structure with adaptive leader selection
- **Lightweight Consensus**: Energy-efficient two-phase consensus protocol activating only 51% adjacent quorum
- **Hybrid Architecture**: On-chain metadata for provenance, off-chain vector storage for efficiency
- **Edge-Optimized**: Designed for resource-constrained environments with microsecond-level latencies

### Performance Highlights

- **57.8% higher throughput** than FAISS at low workloads
- **38Ã— improvement** over blockchain-based alternatives (Binecone)
- **Microsecond-level latencies** (11-25 microseconds)
- **22.5% lower memory usage** compared to non-sharded approaches
- **Linear scalability** up to 200+ nodes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7.0 or higher
- Linux/Unix environment (tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8)
- MPI implementation (MPICH2 recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM per node
- Network connectivity between nodes

### Dependencies

Install required packages:
